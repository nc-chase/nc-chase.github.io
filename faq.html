    <h3>My runner is not at school</h3>

    <p>Too bad ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><br>
        On a more serious note, no realistic solution has been figured out for this issue. <br>
        If you think you could come up with a solution that would work, <br>
        contact gamemaster@newlands.school.nz or goelv@newlands.school.nz as NC Chase is still in the testing phase. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Cheating</h3>

    <p>
        First thing first, check the rules on the home page to make sure what they did was against the rules. <br>
        If you are sure they are cheating, report it to gamemaster@newlands.school.nz or goelv@newlands.school.nz. <br>
