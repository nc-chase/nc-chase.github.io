    <h3>General</h3>

    <p>
        The game only runs before school, interval & lunch. <br>
        You may run away and prevent your Chaser from catching you. <br>
        Your assigned runner is changed each day (even if you don't catch them). <br>
        Every player is also the runner to another player. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>

    <p>
        No breaking school rules. <br>
        No one should ever have to use force. Doors should not be busted down etc. <br>
        Attaching a peg to a bag does NOT count. <br>
        Do not play in the hall, LSC or Office. <br>
        Clubs are safe spaces - please don't interrupt club activities.  <br><br>
        
        Most importantly, use your common sense when playing. If a space doesn't seem appropriate to play in, don't. <br>
