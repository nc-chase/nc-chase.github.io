    <h3>Tagging</h3>

    <p> To catch your runner, clip a clothes peg to their clothing (not their bag). <br>
        Once you have done this, obtain their 'player ID' (by asking). <br>
        Submit the tag by completing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSl_aUlRSxo38dSKs_uwD1IIEvK10zDnnvyigN4Jlrw8qNjA/viewform?usp=sf_link">caught form</a> with your and your runners player ID. <br>
    
    <h3>Being tagged</h3>

    <p> If you have been tagged: <br><br>
        
        Provide your player ID to your chaser. <br>
        Do not chase after your runner as it will not count as a tag. <br>
    </p>
