    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>NC Chase is a live-action <strong>chase</strong> game. Everyone is trying to evade being caught, <br> and trying to catch their own runner. <br>
        Every morning, you will receive an email with your player ID, and your runner's name & Form Class.<br> 
        Your mission is to identify, track down, and catch your runner by placing a clothing peg on them. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the same way that you're chasing someone, someone is also chasing you!<br>
        So, to survive you'll need to play both offensively and defensively to make it through the week. <br>
        Your team is your house, who will never be chasing you. <br>
